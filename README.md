You will find here problems and solutions I found worth tackling. They have been chosen for my own interest to gain knowledge. 
They normally involve solving problems where i had to learn about how to use data structures and algorithms.
These problems can be found on 
- hackerrank
- geeksforgeeks   

Code Kata:

Train my mental muscle to make it my second nature to see through a problem, break it down into smaller chunks and figure out the best 
possible approach to solve them. It includes seeing pattern in problems: 
is this is a simple sorted list and search problem?
